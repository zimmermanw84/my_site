    Hello! Nice to meet you. My name is Walt Zimmerman and I am a full stack web developer. My passion for technology started when I was about 10 years old. I built my first computer when I was 13. When I turned 19 I joined the Army, sadly, at that point I lost interest in computers. When I got out of the Army I didn't have any direction in my life. To make ends meet I got a job dealing poker in a casino. I dealt for 7 years and when I turned 30 I felt like it was time for a change. While I learned a lot about life and people, I had very little translatable skills to an ever evolving work force. So I decided to re-introduce myself to my childhood passion, computers. My wife is a Dev Bootcamp graduate and a dedicated Viggle web developer in San Francisco and encouraged me to follow in her footsteps… So I did. I recently graduated Dev Bootcamp and I am having a blast building web applications. I wish I would have done this years ago. I truly believe that I was meant for this line of work. I am ready to work and exited for the opportunity to be apart of your team. Let’s build something great together!!
